# Proxy Website

This is a pet and experimental project to test cloud deployments and proxy implementations.

The goal is to have a very simple proxy website in Next.js to bypass geographical restrictions of common websites (for example, Discord in Turkey).

The website is deployed on Vercel to allow the cloud servers to act as a proxy.
